Yes, I know it's probably the most predictable 'first blog post title ever' for a software developer but even so, 'From small seeds do mighty tree's grow' and all that.

This blog is inspired by one of the amazing [Julia Evans more recent posts](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/20/blogging-principles/), and is basically intended to be a resource for the past version of myself, supplying the posts I wished I'd had when I was trying to learn about the range of subjects.

I'd like to tell you that this blog will be a focussed and coherent learning resource, but there's not a chance in hell - the things I will be blogging about will range from the JVM stack, through various types of cryptography, to little stories that I've heard or rants I want to get off my chest, I'll try and make sure they're correctly tagged for you all though.
